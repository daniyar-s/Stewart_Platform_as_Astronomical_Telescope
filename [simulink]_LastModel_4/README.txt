To run the inverse kinematics code:
1. Open 'InvKinematics.m' file
2. Write coordinates of an object in the sky by finding the variable 'obj_point' 
around the line 35. 
   obj_point = [x y z]
3 Run the code

To run the dynamic simulation
1. Clear the workspace in the Matlab
2. Open and run the file "New_New_Aligned_System_Assembly_DataFile.m"
3. Open the file "sm_import_stewart_platformRus.slx"
4. Once the Simulink is started, give the same coordinates to [obj_x, obj_y, obj_z]
5. Run the simulation.
